# gns3networkproject
University Network: 

We have taken a small university network as our network scenario. A university called “MDBW” has its own network with 4 VLANS. 
It has 2 departments which are Computing department and Admin department in the main network and 2 Marketing offices in 2 different locations. 
Those marketing offices has only one VLAN for each. We have 2 leased line cables from ISP to connect Main campus and Marketing offices. 
We will be using Star Topology for this scenario with use of Switching network and Virtual Local Area Networks.
